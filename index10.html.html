												<p>I have never met anybody so passionate about her local name, that quality was the first thing that caught my attention.
												She became my facebook friend in April, 2010, but we didn't start talking till later that year. Like every other facebook chats, it started
												with a simple <i>hello</i> and her reply, as expected, <i>hi</i>. We had long and sensible chats, I always looked forward to the next time 
												i catch her online.</p>

												<figcaption>The Weird Profile Picture</figcaption>
												</figure>
												
												<p>The best thing about her was her modesty, for someone so beautiful and responsible, that said a lot about the type of woman she will grow up
												to be. So how did I find her? Easy! My cousin, Ogbue Vivian, was a student of <acronym title="Our Lady of Apostles Secondary School, Yaba">
												OLASS, Yaba</acronym>, she was my friend on <abbr title="Facebook">FB</abbr>, as a result, I saw a lot of <i><b>Olarians</b></i>
												, as they called themselves in my <i>people you may know</i>. Me, the new guy, I added every one of them. Suddenly, I saw this profile, a bit empty
												, not too much activity but a couple of mutual friends, what intrigued me was the profile picture, I mean who snaps a full face and then crops the picture
												to reveal a part of her face and her left eye, I was stuck on the face for a few seconds, didn't even know when I added her.</p>

												<figure class="selected02">
												<img src="C:\Users\benny92\Desktop\Programming Jargons\Images\phone number.png" width="250px" height="200px" alt="Really!" title="Really!! Really!!!" />

												<p><del>Few</del> <ins class= "selected011">Many</ins> months of chatting yielded fruit in May, 2011. We had a unique way of talking to each other, the
												re I was, in the house, the minutes I bought at the cybercafe expired when I was asking for her phone number for the umpteenth time
												, I was really pained but my eyes lit up when i saw a message in my facebook inbox, using the last of my <abbr title="megabytes">MB</abbr> on my phone
												, I opened it and read; "Here's the inbox stuff(as yhu culd it) : 0818xxxxxxx", I was too excited to jump. That day marked the beginning of a new journey 
												of love for me. I would say that message is still the best message I have received in a facebook inbox.</p>

												</figure>

												<p>She kept surprising me this way, a few days after I got her number, she called me around 12:30am, me being the insomniac picked on the first
												ring. We talked, we admired each other's voice, we talked like we didn't just meet on facebook, my cousin who was in the room with me was surprised#
												at how animated I was because of a phone call. We talked for more nights after that one, It didn't matter to me that I was a predegree student who
												was supposed to be studying day and night to get admission into <acronym title="Delta state university">DELSU</acronym>, I just wanted to talk to my
												choc every other night.</p>
												
												<figure class="selected04">
												<img src="C:\Users\benny92\Desktop\Programming Jargons\Images\chat2.png" width="250px" height="200px" alt="Really!" title="Really!! Really!!!" />
												<figcaption>I loved this one!</figcaption>
												</figure>

												<p>She's my longest conquest yet.... (Oh wait! I studied Civil Engineering for 5 years... Nah! doesn't count) Anyways, I asked her out and it took three months
												to get an answer, and that was even after much pestering (I pestered her life mehn!). It was not easy for me as I was developing something I never 
												knew I had in me: Patience. The good part was that she kept assuring me everything was alright, everything would be fine and that I had nothing
												to worry about, she was right. I had everything to be excited about. Fast forward to September 7, 2011; Sopuru Vanessa Onwudiwe became my first 
												offcial girlfriend. I don't think I've had any better birthday.</p>
