				<h1>Civil Engineering's Place In My Heart</h1>
				
				<p>I intended to pick civil engineering after an advice from an uncle</p>
				
				
				<p>I read all i could find about it and did a lot of comparisons with the other disciplines of engineering. <br/>I saw how diversified it is and decided since it has always been against my nature to be stuck doing one thing all the time, i've always loved being dynamic, <i>Civil engineering</i> gives me that.
				
				<p><b>Civil Engineering</b> in my opinion is the <i>best thing</i> that ever happened to engineering</p>
				
				
				<p>I have always been intrigued by really tall buildings and bridges, i read about types of bridges just for the fun of it. My head would always ask me "how do you think that building is standing like that?"</p>
				

				<p><b>Civil Engineering is the best ever field of Engineering</b></p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p>P.S I know a few things about         <b>Prestressed Concrete</b>      now, so it's safe to say I won't be designing any bridges for now. LOL</p>
